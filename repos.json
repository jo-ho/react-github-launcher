    "content": "# Endless Sky\n\nExplore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...\n\n------\n\nEndless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.\n\nSee the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.\n\n# Installing the game\nOfficial releases of Endless Sky are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases) and on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404410/Endless_Sky/). A PPA is available for [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~mzahniser/+archive/ubuntu/endless-sky). Other package managers may also include the game, though the specific version provided may not be up-to-date.\n\n## System Requirements\nEndless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. The most restrictive requirement is likely that your device must support at least OpenGL 3.\n\n|| Minimum | Recommended |\n|---|----:|----:|\n|RAM | 400 MB | 1 GB |\n|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |\n|Storage Free | 200 MB | 400 MB |\n\n## Building from source\nMost development is done on Linux and Windows, using the [SCons](https://scons.org/) build tool to compile the project. For those wishing to use an IDE, project files are provided for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) to simplify the project setup. It is possible to use other IDEs or build systems to compile the game, but support is not provided.  \nFor full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/readme-developer.md) readme.\n\n# Contributing\nAs a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many peoples' work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well.\n\nEndless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users.\n\n# Licensing\nEndless Sky is a free, open source game. The [source code](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/) is available under the GPL v3 license, and all the artwork is either public domain or released under a variety of Creative Commons licenses. (To determine the copyright status of any of the artwork, consult the [copyright file](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/copyright).)\n",

    "content": "--- DISCLAIMER ---\r\n    FrogComposband may ruin your social life, work productivity, or\r\n    daily exercise routine. You play the game at your own risk; in no\r\n    event shall the FrogComposband authors owe you a new keyboard, or\r\n    be liable to you for any other direct, indirect, punitive, magical\r\n    or other injuries or damages of any nature whatsoever.\r\n\r\n----- How to install -----\r\n\r\n--- LINUX (instructions by Chris Kousky; lightly edited)\r\n  Download and unpack the source archive, or clone the git repository:\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/sulkasormi/frogcomposband.git\r\n\r\n  Make sure you have the appropriate development packages installed.\r\n  For example, you might run (Ubuntu or Mint):\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install autoconf gcc libc6-dev libncursesw5-dev libx11-dev\r\n\r\n  From the root of the source archive:\r\n    $ sh autogen.sh\r\n    $ ./configure\r\n    $ make clean\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\n  To install, you may need to elevate your credentials:\r\n    $ su\r\n    $ make install\r\n    $ exit\r\n\r\n  Then run frogcomposband as desired:\r\n    $ frogcomposband -- -n<number of windows>  ## for normal ASCII graphics (recommended)\r\n  or\r\n    $ frogcomposband -g -- -n<# of windows>    ## for 8x8 tile graphics \r\n\r\n  NOTE: some users have reported installation problems when compiling under\r\n  Linux (and Mac). Running ./configure using the --with-no-install parameter\r\n  will bypass this issue by building an executable to run in-place.\r\n\r\n  You can change game windows' font, location, and size, by environment \r\n  variables, for example:\r\n    $ set env ANGBAND_X11_FONT '-*-*-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'\r\n    $ frogcomposband -- -n\r\n\r\n  Then font size will be changed.\r\n\r\n  You can set ANGBAND_X11_FONT_n for a specific window which has window number n.\r\n  Window locations are ANGBAND_X11_AT_X_n and ANGBAND_X11_AT_Y_n.\r\n  Window sizes are ANGBAND_X11_COLS_n and ANGBAND_X11_ROWS_n.\r\n\r\n  (Thanks to Nick McConnell for implementing and improving building under Linux/MAC!)\r\n\r\n  (ALT: For development, doing an install is undesirable. Try the following instead:\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install clang-3.5 llvm-3.5\r\n    $ sh autogen.sh\r\n    $ ./configure SANITIZE_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address --with-no-install CC=clang-3.5\r\n    $ make clean\r\n    $ make -j4\r\n    $ cp src/frogcomposband .\r\n    $ ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer-3.5 ./frogcomposband -g -u<Savefile> -- -n1\r\n    \r\n    Note: Never pass sanitizer flags to CFLAGS as sanitizing configure causes it to fail.\r\n    Instead, configure will append SANITIZE_FLAGS to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS once it has finished\r\n    generating test programs. (see configure.ac)\r\n\r\n    Note, you need to remember to copy the executable up after every build (TODO: Fix Makefile to do this!)\r\n    Also, I like to develop with the address sanitizer enabled at all times. This works best with clang as\r\n    your compiler, rather than gcc. Of course, 3.5 should be replaced with latest version of clang.).\r\n\r\n    ***Fonts on Linux: My experience with linux has been that the fonts are just plain awful. Here, I document\r\n    how I managed to install better fonts and use them in FrogComposband. I spent nearly a day on this, so I'm\r\n    hoping this might prove useful to somebody else. But mostly, it is here to remind me how I did so I don't\r\n    stumble so much next time.\r\n\r\n    [1] Install some better fonts. For example\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install fonts-liberation\r\n\r\n    [2] See what fonts are on your system that FrogComposband can use:\r\n    $ xlsfonts\r\n    Notice that the new fonts aren't there!\r\n\r\n    [3] Find where the new fonts were installed. For example\r\n    $ fc-list | grep liberation\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSansNarrow-Italic.ttf: Liberation Sans Narrow:style=Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: Liberation Sans:style=Regular\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-BoldItalic.ttf: Liberation Mono:style=Bold Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSerif-Italic.ttf: Liberation Serif:style=Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-Bold.ttf: Liberation Mono:style=Bold\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSansNarrow-Regular.ttf: Liberation Sans Narrow:style=Regular\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSerif-Bold.ttf: Liberation Serif:style=Bold\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-Regular.ttf: Liberation Mono:style=Regular\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-Italic.ttf: Liberation Sans:style=Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSerif-BoldItalic.ttf: Liberation Serif:style=Bold Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSansNarrow-BoldItalic.ttf: Liberation Sans Narrow:style=Bold Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationMono-Italic.ttf: Liberation Mono:style=Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-BoldItalic.ttf: Liberation Sans:style=Bold Italic\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf: Liberation Serif:style=Regular\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSansNarrow-Bold.ttf: Liberation Sans Narrow:style=Bold\r\n    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-Bold.ttf: Liberation Sans:style=Bold\r\n\r\n    [4] Bang head on wall in frustration!!\r\n\r\n    [5] Tell X Server about the fonts:\r\n    $ cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/\r\n    $ su\r\n    $ mkfontscale\r\n    $ mkfontdir\r\n    $ exit\r\n    $ cat fonts.dir\r\n    ...\r\n    LiberationMono-Regular.ttf -misc-liberation mono-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-adobe-standard\r\n    LiberationMono-Regular.ttf -misc-liberation mono-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-ascii-0\r\n    LiberationMono-Regular.ttf -misc-liberation mono-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-ibm-cp437\r\n    ... [and many more]\r\n\r\n    $ xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation\r\n    $ xset fp rehash\r\n    $ xlsfonts | grep liberation\r\n    ...\r\n    -misc-liberation sans-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1\r\n    -misc-liberation sans-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-10\r\n    -misc-liberation sans-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-13\r\n    -misc-liberation sans-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-15\r\n    -misc-liberation sans-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-16\r\n    ... [and many more]\r\n\r\n    [6] Now, try to find a font you like. For example:\r\n    $ cd [path to frogcomposband]\r\n    ~/Src/frogcomposband> ANGBAND_X11_FONT='-misc-liberation mono-medium-r-normal--20-0-0-0-m-0-iso8859-1' ./frogcomposband -mx11\r\n    You can play with the point size since these are vector fonts. I chose 20pt since my eyes suck!\r\n\r\n    [7] Smile. Grab beer to recover from step [4].\r\n\r\n--- Curses\r\n\r\n  Curses is for Linux, of course, so everything said above also applies here.\r\n  To run with a single 'big' terminal, simply run, for example:\r\n    $ ./frogcomposband -mgcu -uCrusher\r\n\r\n  To add additional terminal windows, you need to specify sub-options. You can\r\n  configure, from the command line, a strip of terminals on the right hand side\r\n  of the screen, or on the bottom of the screen, or both.\r\n\r\n  For example:\r\n    $ ./frogcomposband -mgcu -uCrusher -- -right 57x26,*\r\n\r\n  This specifies that the right hand strip will be be 57 columns wide, and will\r\n  contain 2 additional terminals. The first one, on top, will be 57x26 (i.e., 26\r\n  rows high) while the second terminal will be 57x(LINES-26) (i.e., * means fill\r\n  to whatever is leftover). These terminals will be numbered 1 and 2, respectively.\r\n\r\n  Another example:\r\n    $ ./frogcomposband -mgcu -uCrusher -- -bottom -bottom *x10\r\n\r\n  This adds a bottom strip 10 rows high, and this strip will contain a single\r\n  additional terminal window (numbered as Term-1) that will be as wide as the\r\n  screen allows (i.e, Term-1 will be COLSx10).\r\n\r\n  Finally, you can combine the -right and -bottom commands, in either order.\r\n  For example:\r\n    $ ./frogcomposband -mgcu -uCrusher -- -right 57x26,* -bottom *x10\r\n\r\n  Here, Term-1 and Term-2 are on the right strip, sized as 57x26 and 57x(LINES-26),\r\n  while Term-3 is on the bottom strip, sized (COLS-57)x10. Term-0, the Main Terminal,\r\n  is, of course, located in the top left and sized as (COLS-57)x(LINES-10). The\r\n  map terminal will always use as much space as possible.\r\n\r\n  Finally, the order of the -right and -bottom command is significant, as it affects\r\n  both the child terminal numbering and also resolves the conflict over the overlap\r\n  region in the bottom-right corner of the screen.\r\n\r\n  For example, the meaning of the following should now be clear:\r\n    $ ./frogcomposband -mgcu -uCrusher -- -bottom *x10 -right 57x26,*\r\n\r\n  You cannot specify more than 7 child terminals.\r\n\r\n--- Windows\r\n\r\n  Download the binary archive for Windows.  Unzip it to any location that you \r\n  will have full permissions and launch frogcomposband to play.\r\n\r\n  To compile the source code in MinGW:\r\n  $ ./autogen.sh\r\n  $ ./configure --enable-win\r\n  $ make\r\n\r\n  MinGW sometimes randomly chokes on one of these steps, in which case you\r\n  will need to redo that step.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------  Basics  ------------\r\n\r\n  The in-game documentation has been updated for FrogComposband 7.1.liquorice.\r\n  Press '?' to activate the help system, then select your favorite topic; e.g.\r\n  press 'a' twice for General Information; press 'a' followed by 'b' for an\r\n  introduction to the help files and how to best read them [yes, this is that\r\n  kind of manual!]; press 'a' followed by 'j' for the Newbie Guide. If you\r\n  get lost in the depths of the help system, press '!' to return to the\r\n  help's main page.\r\n\r\n  Helpfiles are also available as HTML files for viewing outside the game\r\n  in your favorite browser; for example, the General Information page is at\r\n  lib/help/html/general.html and the Newbie Guide at lib/help/html/tang.html.\r\n\r\n  If you are still stuck, you can usually find friendly people at angband.live\r\n  who will try to help you out.\r\n\r\n---------  Commands  ----------- \r\n\r\n  Again, please refer to the in-game help; press '?' for help and then 'c'\r\n  for Commands. Choose the section that interests you (\"Command Descriptions\"\r\n  is a separate, lengthy file that explains all commands in detail).\r\n\r\n  Or open lib/help/html/command.html or lib/help/html/commdesc.html in your browser.\r\n\r\n--- Most of this file inherited from PosChengband, updated for FrogComposband 7.1.liquorice.\r\n",
