    "content": "         NetHack 3.7.0 work-in-progress -- General information\n\nNetHack 3.7 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack,\nwhich is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of\nNetHack 3.6.\n\nNetHack 3.7.0 work-in-progress is not a release of NetHack. As a .0 version,\nand still very early in its development cycle, there has already been changes\nmade, and there will continue to be many more prior to an eventual release.\nThe file doc/fixes37.0 in the source distribution will be updated with a list\nof fixes as they are committed.\n\nIn short -- there are likely to be bugs. Don't treat NetHack-3.7 branch as\nreleased code, and if stability is paramount, then the most recent\nNetHack 3.6.6 release is safest for you.\n\nWe're making the .0 work-in-progress available so that you can observe, test\nout, and contribute to its development. Constructive suggestions, GitHub pull\nrequests, and bug reports are all welcome and encouraged.\n\nThe file doc/fixes37.0 in the source distribution has a full list of bug-fixes\nincluded so far, as well as brief mentions of some of the other code changes.\nThe text in there was written for the development team's own use and is\nprovided  \"as is\", so please do not ask us to further explain the entries in\nthat file. Some entries might be considered \"spoilers\", particularly in the\n\"new features\" section.\n\nAlong with the game improvements and bug fixes, NetHack 3.7 strives to make\nsome general architectural improvements to the game or to its building\nprocess. Among them:\n\n *  Remove barriers to building NetHack on one platform and operating system,\n    for later execution on another (possibly quite different) platform and/or\n    operating system. That capability is generally known as \"cross-compiling.\"\n    See the file \"Cross-compiling\" in the top-level folder for more information\n    on that.\n\n *  Replace the build-time \"yacc and lex\"-based level compiler, the \"yacc and\n    lex\"-based dungeon compiler, and the quest text file processing done\n    by NetHack's \"makedefs\" utility, with Lua text alternatives that are\n    loaded and processed by the game during play.\n\n *  Write game savefiles and bonesfiles in a more portable and consistent way\n    to open up the possibility of utilizing them between different platforms,\n    such as between your desktop computer and your hand-held device.\n\n *  Add support to make the game restartable without exit (a.k.a. \"play again\"\n    support). Toward that end, many previously scattered and separate variables\n    have been gathered into a central 'g' structure in decl.h/decl.c. That\n    will benefit the porting effort to some platforms that are under\n    consideration.\n\nHere are some other general notes on the changes in NetHack 3.7 that were not\nconsidered spoilers:\n -  automatic annotation \"gateway to Moloch's Sanctum\" for vibrating square\n        level once that square's location becomes known (found or magic\n        mapped); goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar\n        mapped)\n -  savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into\n        their individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire\n        struct\n -  savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference\n\n                        - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nPlease read items (1), (2) and (3) BEFORE doing anything with your new code.\n\n1.  Unpack the code in a dedicated new directory.  We will refer to that\n    directory as the 'Top' directory.  It makes no difference what you\n    call it.\n\n2.  Having unpacked, you should have a file called 'Files' in your Top\n    directory.\n\n    This file contains the list of all the files you now SHOULD\n    have in each directory.  Please check the files in each directory\n    against this list to make sure that you have a complete set.\n\n    This file also contains a list of what files are created during\n    the build process.\n\n    The names of the directories listed should not be changed unless you\n    are ready to go through the makefiles and the makedefs program and change\n    all the directory references in them.\n\n3.  Before you do anything else, please read carefully the file called\n    \"license\" in the 'dat' subdirectory.  It is expected that you comply\n    with the terms of that license, and we are very serious about it.\n\n4.  If you are attempting to build NetHack on one platform/processor, to\n    produce a game on a different platform/processor it may behoove you to\n    read the file \"Cross-compiling\" in your Top directory.\n\n5.  If everything is in order, you can now turn to trying to get the program\n    to compile and run on your particular system.  It is worth mentioning\n    that the default configuration is SysV/Sun/Solaris2.x (simply because\n    the code was housed on such a system).\n\n    The files sys/*/Install.* were written to guide you in configuring the\n    program for your operating system.  The files win/*/Install.* are\n    available, where necessary, to help you in configuring the program\n    for particular windowing environments.  Reading them, and the man pages,\n    should answer most of your questions.\n\n\n    At the time of the most recent official release, NetHack 3.6, it had\n    been tested to run/compile on:\n\n        Intel Pentium or better (or clone) running Linux, BSDI, or\n                Windows (7 through 10)\n        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) boxes running Linux, or BSDI\n        Mac OS X 10.11 (follow the instructions in sys/unix, not sys/mac)\n        OpenVMS (aka VMS) V8.4 on Alpha and on Integrity/Itanium/IA64\n\n    Instructions have been provided by way of community contribution on:\n        msdos protected mode using djgpp including a Linux-host djgpp\n        cross-compile\n\n    Previous versions of NetHack were tested and known to run on the\n    following systems, but it is unknown if they can still build and\n    execute NetHack 3.6 or NetHack 3.7:\n\n        Apple Macintosh running MacOS 7.5 or higher, LinuxPPC, BeOS 4.0\n        Atari ST/TT/Falcon running TOS (or MultiTOS) with GCC\n        AT&T 3B1 running System V (3.51)\n        AT&T 3B2/600 & 3B2/622 running System V R3.2.1\n        AT&T 3B2/1000 Model 80 running System V R3.2.2\n        AT&T 3B4000 running System V\n        AT&T 6386 running System V R3.2\n        Commodore Amiga running AmigaDOS 3.0 or higher with SAS/C 6.x\n                (but see Makefile.ami about DICE and Manx)\n        Data General AViiON systems running DG/UX\n        DEC Alpha/VMS (aka OpenVMS AXP), running V1.x through V7.1\n        DEC VAX/VMS, running V4.6 through V7.1\n        DEC vaxen running BSD, Ultrix\n        Decstations running Ultrix 3.1, 4.x\n        Encore Multimax running UMAX 4.2\n        Gould NP1 running UTX 3/2\n        HP 9000s300 running HP-UX\n        HP 9000s700 running HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, 11.x\n        H/PC Pro devices running Windows CE 2.11 and higher.\n        IBM PC/RT and RS/6000 running AIX 3.x\n        IBM PS/2 and AT compatibles running OS/2 - 2.0 and up with GCC emx\n        IBM PS/2 and AT compatibles running OS/2 1.1 - 2.0 (and probably\n           Warp) with Microsoft 6.0, and OS/2 2.0 and up with IBM CSet++ 2.0.\n        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) running 386BSD\n        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) boxes running MS-DOS with DPMI.\n        Intel x86 running a version of Windows prior to XP.\n        Mips M2000 running RiscOS 4.1\n        NeXT running Mach (using BSD configuration)\n        Palm Size PC 1.1 devices running Windows CE 2.11\n        Pocket PC devices running Windows CE 3.0 and higher\n        Pyramid 9820x running OSx 4.4c\n        SGI Iris running IRIX\n        Stardent Vistra 800 running SysV R4.0\n        Stride 460 running UniStride 2.1\n        Sun-3s, -4s, and -386is running SunOS 3.x\n        Sun-3s and -386is running SunOS 4.x\n        Sun SPARC based machine running SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x, or Solaris 7\n        Valid Logic Systems SCALD-System\n\n    Previous versions, using a cross-compiler hosted on another platform,\n    such as  win32, could also build the following from source:\n        Pocket PC devices running Windows CE 3.0 and higher\n        H/PC Pro devices running Windows CE 2.11 and higher\n        Palm Size PC 1.1 devices running Windows CE 2.11\n\n    Unless otherwise mentioned, the compiler used was the OS-vendor's\n    C compiler.\n\n                        - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIf you have problems building the game, or you find bugs in it, we recommend\nfiling a bug report from our \"Contact Us\" web page at:\n    https://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html\nPlease include the version information from #version or the command line\noption --version in the appropriate field.\n\nA public repository of the latest NetHack code that we've made\navailable can be obtained via git here:\n    https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack\n      or\n    https://sourceforge.net/p/nethack/NetHack/\n\nWhen sending correspondence, please observe the following:\no Please be sure to include your machine type, OS, and patchlevel.\no Please avoid sending us binary files (e.g. save files or bones files).\n  If you have found a bug and think that your save file would aid in solving\n  the problem, send us a description in words of the problem, your machine\n  type, your operating system, and the version of NetHack.  Tell us that you\n  have a save file, but do not actually send it.\n  You may then be contacted by a member of the development team with the\n  address of a specific person to send the save file to.\no Though we make an effort to reply to each bug report, it may take some\n  time before you receive feedback.  This is especially true during the\n  period immediately after a new release, when we get the most bug reports.\no We don't give hints for playing the game.\no Don't bother to ask when the next version will be out or you can expect\n  to receive a stock answer.\n\nIf you want to submit a patch for the NetHack source code via email directly,\nyou can direct it to this address:\n    nethack-bugs (at) nethack.org\n\nIf a feature is not accepted you are free, of course, to post the patches\nto the net yourself and let the marketplace decide their worth.\n\nAll of this amounts to the following:  If you decide to apply a free-lanced\npatch to your 3.6 code, you are welcome to do so, of course, but we won't\nbe able to provide support or receive bug reports for it.\n\nIn our own patches, we will assume that your code is synchronized with ours.\n\n                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --\n\n# $NHDT-Date: 1583508658 2020/03/06 15:30:58 $ $NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6-Mar2020 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.80 $\n# Copyright (c) 2012 by Michael Allison\n# NetHack may be freely redistributed.

    "content": "# Endless Sky\n\nExplore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...\n\n------\n\nEndless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.\n\nSee the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.\n\n# Installing the game\nOfficial releases of Endless Sky are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases) and on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404410/Endless_Sky/). A PPA is available for [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~mzahniser/+archive/ubuntu/endless-sky). Other package managers may also include the game, though the specific version provided may not be up-to-date.\n\n## System Requirements\nEndless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. The most restrictive requirement is likely that your device must support at least OpenGL 3.\n\n|| Minimum | Recommended |\n|---|----:|----:|\n|RAM | 400 MB | 1 GB |\n|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |\n|Storage Free | 200 MB | 400 MB |\n\n## Building from source\nMost development is done on Linux and Windows, using the [SCons](https://scons.org/) build tool to compile the project. For those wishing to use an IDE, project files are provided for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) to simplify the project setup. It is possible to use other IDEs or build systems to compile the game, but support is not provided.  \nFor full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/readme-developer.md) readme.\n\n# Contributing\nAs a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many peoples' work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well.\n\nEndless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users.\n\n# Licensing\nEndless Sky is a free, open source game. The [source code](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/) is available under the GPL v3 license, and all the artwork is either public domain or released under a variety of Creative Commons licenses. (To determine the copyright status of any of the artwork, consult the [copyright file](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/copyright).)\n",
